# Welcome to TrackMe+
{: .fs-9 }

Your First 15 Minutes
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

You made an account. You're staring at an empty dashboard. Now what?

This guide walks you through everything you need to get started. No medical jargon, no walls of text. Just follow along and you'll be tracking like a pro in about 15 minutes.

---

## The Big Picture

TrackMe+ does four things really well:

1. **Tracks what you take** (medications, peptides, supplements)
2. **Reminds you when to take it** (your daily schedule)
3. **Tracks what you spend** (purchases, vendors, budgets)
4. **Tracks your health data** (lab results, weight, blood pressure)

You don't have to set up everything today. Start with your medications and daily schedule. Add the rest whenever you're ready.

---

## Step 1: Add Your First Medication
{: .d-inline-block }

2 minutes
{: .label .label-green }

This is the foundation of everything else. Every dose you log, every purchase you track, and every supply you link starts with a medication.

**Here's how:**

1. Click **My Medications** in the sidebar (or **Meds** on mobile)
2. Click the green **+ Add Medication** button
3. Fill in the basics:

| Field | What to Enter | Example |
|:------|:-------------|:--------|
| Name | What you're taking | Semaglutide |
| Type | Vial, Pen, Pills, Drops, Powder, Cream, or Patches | Vial |
| Dose Amount | How much you take each time | 0.5 |
| Unit | The measurement | mg |
| Frequency | How often | Weekly |
| Time of Day | When you take it | 09:00 |

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 3"}
4. Click **Save**

That's it. Your first medication is in the system.

**Don't worry about getting everything perfect.** You can always edit it later. Just get the name, dose, and frequency right for now.

---

## Step 2: Check Your Today Page
{: .d-inline-block }

1 minute
{: .label .label-green }

Now go to **Today** (click it in the sidebar or tap the calendar tab on mobile).

You should see your medication listed with today's scheduled dose. This is your daily checklist. Every day, you come here, see what's due, and check things off.

**To log a dose:**
- Just click the **checkmark** next to the dose. Done. That's the whole process.

**To skip a dose:**
- Click **Skip**, pick a reason (forgot, out of stock, side effects, etc.), and it gets recorded. Skipping is better than just ignoring it because your records stay honest.

**To log a dose you already took earlier:**
- Use the date picker at the top of the Today page to go back to that day, then check it off.

---

## Step 3: Add More Medications (and See How Grouping Works)
{: .d-inline-block }

2 minutes
{: .label .label-green }

Here's where it gets interesting. Add another medication, and pay attention to the name.

**How automatic grouping works:**

If you're taking the same thing at different strengths, TrackMe+ groups them together automatically. It matches on the base name.

For example, if you add:
- "Semaglutide 0.25mg"
- "Semaglutide 0.5mg"

Both show up under a **Semaglutide** group header. Click the header to collapse or expand the group. This keeps your medication list clean, especially if you're titrating (gradually increasing your dose over time).

**If you DON'T want them grouped**, just use different names (like "Morning Vitamins" and "Evening Vitamins").

---

## Step 4: Add a Purchase
{: .d-inline-block }

2 minutes
{: .label .label-green }

You bought medications somewhere. Let's track that so you know what you're spending.

1. Click **Budget** in the sidebar (or **More → Budget** on mobile)
2. Click **+ Add Purchase**
3. Fill in:

| Field | What to Enter |
|:------|:-------------|
| Medication | Pick from your list |
| Purchase Date | When you bought it |
| Vendor | Where you bought it |
| Quantity | How many you bought |
| Total Cost | What you paid |

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 3"}
4. Click **Save**

Now your Dashboard will start showing spending data, and your medication cards will show how many days of supply you have left.

---

## Step 5: Add Your Supplies
{: .d-inline-block }

3 minutes
{: .label .label-green }

If you use syringes, needles, alcohol swabs, or anything else alongside your medications, track them here so you never run out.

**Note:** Supplies tracking requires a Standard plan or higher.
{: .text-yellow-300 }

1. Click **Supplies** in the sidebar (or **More → Supplies** on mobile)
2. Click **+ Add Supply**
3. Fill in:

| Field | What to Enter | Example |
|:------|:-------------|:--------|
| Name | What it is | 29G Insulin Syringes |
| Type | Syringe, Needle, Swab, etc. | Syringe |
| Quantity | How many you have now | 50 |
| Reorder Threshold | When to warn you | 10 |

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 3"}
4. Click **Save**

You'll see a card for each supply with a color-coded status:
- 🟢 **In Stock** — you're good
- 🟡 **Low Stock** — time to reorder
- 🔴 **Out of Stock** — you need these now

### Link Supplies to Medications

This is the magic part. When you link a supply to a medication, TrackMe+ automatically subtracts from your inventory every time you log a dose.

1. Open a medication (click on its card)
2. Click **Link Supplies**
3. Pick a supply from the dropdown (like "29G Insulin Syringes")
4. Enter how many you use per dose (usually 1)
5. Click **Add**

Now when you check off a dose on the Today page, your syringe count goes down by one. No extra work on your part.

---

## Step 6: Add a Vendor
{: .d-inline-block }

1 minute
{: .label .label-green }

Keep track of where you buy things. This makes purchases faster to enter and lets you compare prices later.

1. Click **Purchased From** in the sidebar (or **More → Vendors** on mobile)
2. Click **+ Add Vendor**
3. Enter the company name, website, and any notes
4. Click **Save**

Now when you add purchases, you can pick this vendor from a dropdown instead of typing it every time.

---

## Your Daily Routine
{: .d-inline-block }

2 minutes a day
{: .label .label-purple }

Once everything is set up, here's all you need to do each day:

1. **Open TrackMe+**
2. **Go to Today**
3. **Check off your doses** as you take them
4. **That's it**

Seriously. The daily part is just checking boxes. All the setup work you did pays off here.

## Other Useful Features (When You're Ready)
{: .text-purple-300 }

You don't need to learn all of these today. Come back when you need them.

### Track Your Weight
Go to **Vitals → Weight** (or **More → Weight History** on mobile). Add entries whenever you weigh yourself. You'll see a chart showing your trend over time, plus 7-day and 30-day changes.

### Track Your Blood Pressure
Go to **Vitals → Blood Pressure** (or **More → BP History** on mobile). Enter your systolic, diastolic, and pulse. The app color-codes your reading (green = normal, yellow = elevated, orange = high, red = crisis) so you can see where you stand at a glance.

### Track Lab Results
Go to **Lab Results** (or **Labs** on mobile). Enter your blood work results with the reference ranges from your lab report. The app marks each result as Normal or Abnormal.

**Premium users** can take a photo of their lab report and let the AI read it automatically. Way faster than typing everything in.

### Set Up Cycle Tracking (Premium)
If you take medications in on/off cycles (like 12 weeks on, 4 weeks off), turn on **Is Cycle** when editing the medication. Set the cycle length and washout period. The app shows you exactly where you are: "Day 45 of 84" or "Rest Day 10" or "Ready to Start."

### Use the Dose Timer
Taking two injections that need to be spaced apart? Start the dose timer after your first injection. It counts down and sends you a notification when it's time for the next one. The timer keeps running even if you close your browser.

### Generate a Doctor Report
Going to a doctor's appointment? Go to **Reports → Doctor Printout** and generate a clean, professional summary of your medications, doses, and lab results. Print it or save it as a PDF. Doctors love this because it's organized and complete.

### Export Your Data
Go to **Settings → Data → Export All Data**. You'll get a ZIP file with spreadsheets of everything. Open them in Excel or Google Sheets for your own analysis.
