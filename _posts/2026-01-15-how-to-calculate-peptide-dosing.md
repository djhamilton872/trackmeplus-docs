# How to Calculate Peptide Dosing: A Complete Guide

*January 15, 2026*

If you've ever stared at a vial of lyophilized peptide and wondered "how many units do I draw?" - you're not alone. Peptide dosing math trips up beginners and veterans alike. This guide breaks it down step by step.

## The Basic Formula

Here's the formula you need:

```
Dose (ml) = Desired mcg ÷ Concentration (mcg/ml)
```

Where concentration = Total peptide (mcg) ÷ BAC water added (ml)

### Example: BPC-157

- **Vial contains:** 5mg (5,000 mcg)
- **You add:** 2ml BAC water
- **Concentration:** 5,000 ÷ 2 = 2,500 mcg/ml
- **Your dose:** 250 mcg
- **Draw:** 250 ÷ 2,500 = 0.1 ml (10 units on insulin syringe)

## Converting ML to Syringe Units

Most insulin syringes are "100-unit" syringes, meaning:
- 1 ml = 100 units
- 0.1 ml = 10 units
- 0.5 ml = 50 units

So if your calculation says "0.1 ml" - draw to the 10 mark.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Confusing mg and mcg
- 1 mg = 1,000 mcg
- Most peptide doses are in mcg, but vials are often labeled in mg
- Always convert to the same unit before calculating

### 2. Not accounting for BAC water amount
More water = weaker concentration = larger injection volume. There's no "right" amount, but common choices:
- 1 ml = concentrated, smaller injections
- 2 ml = moderate, easier to measure
- 3 ml = dilute, very easy to measure precisely

### 3. Forgetting dead space
Syringes have a small amount of "dead space" in the needle hub. For precise dosing, some people:
- Draw a tiny air bubble first
- Or use low dead-space syringes

## The Easy Way: Use a Tracker

Doing this math every time is tedious and error-prone. That's why we built [TrackMe+](https://trackmeplus.com) with a built-in dosing calculator.

Enter your:
- Peptide amount (mg)
- BAC water volume (ml)
- Desired dose (mcg)

Get back:
- Exact ml to draw
- Syringe units for both 100-unit and 3ml syringes
- How many doses per vial

## Quick Reference Table

| Vial Size | BAC Water | Concentration | 250mcg Dose |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| 5mg | 1ml | 5,000 mcg/ml | 5 units |
| 5mg | 2ml | 2,500 mcg/ml | 10 units |
| 10mg | 2ml | 5,000 mcg/ml | 5 units |
| 10mg | 3ml | 3,333 mcg/ml | 7.5 units |

## What About Other Form Types?

Peptides aren't the only thing that needs tracking. If you're managing a full health protocol with:
- 💉 Injections (peptides, TRT, insulin)
- 💊 Pills (supplements, prescriptions)
- 🩹 Patches (hormone, nicotine)
- 💧 Drops (sublingual compounds)
- 🧪 Powders (creatine, pre-workout)

You need a system that handles all of it. [TrackMe+](https://trackmeplus.com) tracks every form type with the right calculator for each.
